Here is a detailed explanation of the codes above:

The code implements various bubble sorting algorithms' variations for an integer array of size 10. It presents a menu to the user with the following options:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Modified Bubble Sort
3. Recursive Bubble Sort
4. Cocktail Shaker Sort
5. Comb Sort
6. Exit

The user can choose any of these options to sort the array using the corresponding algorithm. The array is generated randomly with values between 0 and 100.

The code defines a module called MainModule, which contains the implementations of the sorting algorithms as subroutines. The first four subroutines are standard bubble sort, modified bubble sort, recursive bubble sort, and cocktail shaker sort, respectively. The fifth subroutine is comb sort.

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
This algorithm compares each pair of adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It then repeats this process until the array is sorted. It is called Bubble Sort because the largest elements "bubble" to the top of the array.

Modified bubble sort is an optimized version of bubble sort that stops if no swaps occur in a pass. This optimization improves the worst-case complexity of bubble sort from O(n^2) to O(n) for already sorted arrays.
This algorithm is similar to Bubble Sort, but it adds an extra check to see if any swaps have been made in a pass through the array. If no swaps have been made, then the array must be sorted and the algorithm exits. This can make the algorithm more efficient for partially sorted arrays.

Recursive bubble sort is a recursive version of bubble sort that uses recursion to sort the array. The algorithm calls itself until the base case is reached, which is when the array is of size 1. The largest element is then fixed, and the algorithm recurs for the remaining array.
This algorithm is a recursive version of Bubble Sort. It works by making a single pass through the array, swapping adjacent elements as needed. It then recursively sorts the remaining unsorted elements until the entire array is sorted.

Cocktail shaker sort is a bidirectional bubble sort that sorts the array in both directions alternatively to reduce the number of passes. It works by traversing the array from both ends, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
This algorithm is a bidirectional version of Bubble Sort. It sorts the array in both directions alternately, which can reduce the number of passes needed to fully sort the array.

Comb sort is a sorting algorithm that improves bubble sort by using a gap of size more than 1. The gap starts with a large value and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 until it reaches the value 1. The shrink factor is chosen to be 1.3 because it is empirically the best value to use.
This algorithm is similar to Bubble Sort, but it uses a larger gap between elements to compare. The gap starts at the length of the array and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 until it reaches a value of 1. This can make the algorithm more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger arrays.

The Main() subroutine presents the menu to the user and allows them to select an option. It then generates a random array of size 10 and calls the corresponding sorting subroutine. After sorting, it displays the sorted array to the user.

The program continues to present the menu until the user chooses the Exit option.
