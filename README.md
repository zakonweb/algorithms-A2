# A2 Algorithm Codes Repository

This repository is a collection of algorithm codes implemented in Python, Java, VB, and pseudocode, along with detailed explanations and variations. The repository is structured based on the syllabus and comprises the following directories:

## Directories

- `BINARY SEARCH`
- `BUBBLE SORT`
- `INSERT SORT`
- `RECURSION`
- `REVERSE POLISH NOTATION`
- `TRY-CATCH`

Each directory includes the code for the corresponding algorithm in Python, Java, VB, and pseudocode, as well as extensive explanations and variations for each algorithm.

## Recursion and Iterative

This repository includes algorithms implemented using both recursion and iterative methods whereever is possible, providing examples of different styles of programming.
