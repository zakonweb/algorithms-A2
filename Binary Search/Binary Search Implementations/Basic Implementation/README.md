# Detailed Explanation of Iterative Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is a classic search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found, or until the search interval is empty. Binary search is a very efficient algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the array.

## Basic Explanation

The `iterativeBinarySearch()` function is an implementation of binary search that takes an array of integers and a target integer as input, and returns the index of the target element in the array. 

1. The function starts by initializing the left and right indices of the search space to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. 
2. It then enters a while loop that continues searching as long as the search space is not empty.
3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index of the search space and checks if the middle element is equal to the target. If it is, the function returns the index of the middle element. 
4. If the middle element is smaller than the target, the function updates the left index to be the middle index plus one, which restricts the search space to the right half of the array. 
5. If the middle element is larger than the target, the function updates the right index to be the middle index minus one, which restricts the search space to the left half of the array. 
6. The function then loops back to the start of the while loop to continue the search.
7. If the target is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

## Advanced Explanation

The `iterativeBinarySearch()` function exhibits several notable features in its implementation.

1. The initialization of left and right indices: `left = 0` and `right = length of the array - 1`. This is the starting point for the search space.
2. The while loop's condition is `left <= right`, which means that the search continues as long as there is at least one element in the search space.
3. The calculation of the middle index of the search space using integer division: `int mid = (left + right) MOD 2`. This gives the index of the middle element in the array.
4. The middle element is checked against the target, and if it matches, the middle index is returned. If it doesn't match, the search space is updated accordingly.
5. If the middle element is smaller than the target, the left index is updated to be the middle index plus one: `left = mid + 1`. This restricts the search space to the right half of the array.
6. If the middle element is larger than the target, the right index is updated to be the middle index minus one: `right = mid - 1`. This restricts the search space to the left half of the array.
7. If the target is not found, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

The program also includes a main function that provides an interactive interface for the user to choose between iterative and recursive binary search and to specify the target value to search for. This program is an example of modular programming, as it separates the binary search algorithm implementation into a separate function that can be reused and tested independently.

## Possible Improvements

For best practices, the program could be improved by adding error handling for valid integer inputs and ensuring the array is sorted before performing the search. Also, the program could be extended to handle other types of data, such as strings or floating-point numbers, by modifying the comparison and indexing operations accordingly.
