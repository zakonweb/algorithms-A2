Recursive functions:
When a function calls itself from within its body it is called recursive function.
E.g:

X=Factorial(4)

Function Factorial(s as integer) as integer
1.  If (s = 1) Then 'STOP value
2.    Factorial = 1 'return 1
3.  Else
4.    Factorial = Factorial(s-1) * s 'Recursion occuring
5.  Endif
End function

Line 2 and 4 shows that it is a function as it is returning a value there OR because function name is appearing on the left of the Assignment symbol =.

Line 4 shows that it is a RECURSIVE function because function name is appearing on the right side of the Assignment symbol = OR because function is calling itself fro m within its body.
