**Code Overview**

The main goal of the code is to take an infix expression as input, convert it to a postfix expression, and evaluate the postfix expression to get the final result. The program is broken down into several smaller functions that each perform a specific task.

**isOperator(c) Function**

The **isOperator(c)** function is used to check if a given character is an operator. It returns **True** if the character is an operator and **False** otherwise. This function is useful because it allows other functions to easily determine if a given character is an operator or not.

**precedence(c) Function**

The **precedence(c)** function is used to determine the precedence of a given operator. The higher the value returned by this function, the higher the precedence of the operator. This function is useful because it allows other functions to compare the precedence of two operators and determine which one should be evaluated first.

**validateInfix(infix) Function**

The **validateInfix(infix)** function is used to check if the input infix expression is valid or not. It does this by counting the number of opening and closing parentheses in the expression and checking if they match. It also checks if the expression starts or ends with an operator and if there are any invalid characters. This function is useful because it ensures that the input expression is valid before it is converted to a postfix expression.

**infix\_to\_postfix(infix\_expr) Function**

The **infix\_to\_postfix(infix\_expr)** function is used to convert the input infix expression to a postfix expression. It does this using the Shunting Yard algorithm, which uses a stack to keep track of operators and operands. The function loops through each character in the infix expression and does the following:

*   If the character is an operand, it adds it to the output queue.
*   If the character is an operator, it pops operators from the stack and adds them to the output queue until it finds an operator with lower precedence or an opening parenthesis. It then pushes the current operator onto the stack.
*   If the character is an opening parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack.
*   If the character is a closing parenthesis, it pops operators from the stack and adds them to the output queue until it finds the matching opening parenthesis. It does not add the parentheses to the output queue.

After the loop, the function adds any remaining operators on the stack to the output queue. The output queue is then returned as a space-separated string representing the postfix expression.

**evaluatePostfix(postfix\_expr) Function**

The **evaluatePostfix(postfix\_expr)** function is used to evaluate the postfix expression and get the final result. It does this using a stack to keep track of operands and operators. The function loops through each character in the postfix expression and does the following:

*   If the character is an operand, it pushes it onto the stack.
*   If the character is an operator, it pops two operands from the stack, applies the operator to them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

After the loop, the final result is the only element left on the stack. If there are more or fewer than one element on the stack, it means the postfix expression was invalid.

**Main Menu**

Finally, the main menu provides a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the program. The user can choose to enter an infix expression, which is then converted to a postfix expression and evaluated to get the final result. The program also includes example data to test the implementation of the functions.
